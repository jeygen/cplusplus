.cpp is the most widely used and traditional file extension 
for C++ source code.  It stands for "C++ preprocessor" and
reflects the fact that C++ code is first preprocessed by the
C++ preprocessor before it is compiled by the C++ compiler.

.cc is an alternative file extension that is also used for
C++ source code. It stands for "C++ compiler" and is sometimes 
preferred by developers who want to emphasize that the file 
contains C++ code.
