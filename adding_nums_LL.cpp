/*
 * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
 * The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
 * The task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 1. The two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
 * Output: [7,0,8]
 * Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
 * Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1. The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
 * 2. 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 * 3. It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros
