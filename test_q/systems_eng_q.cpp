/*
 Write a program in C++ that mimics a simple power management system. It should be able to add and remove devices, turn them on and off, and check their status.

Given a matrix of integers representing power usage of different components of a system in a time sequence, write a C++ function to find and return the time period where power usage was the highest.

Write a C++ function to simulate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache mechanism that might be used in memory management. It should support the operations 'put' and 'get'.

How would you implement a BIOS POST (Power-On Self Test) sequence in C++? What things would you consider?

Write a multithreaded C++ program that could be used to perform concurrent operations on a system. For instance, one thread for system checks, one for memory management, and another for power management.

Using C++, design a class hierarchy for a set of power-manageable devices with shared and unique properties.

Implement a C++ function that simulates memory allocation and deallocation in a system, managing memory fragmentation.

Let's say you have to write an algorithm to optimize power usage in a system based on active hours. How would you design this algorithm in C++?
